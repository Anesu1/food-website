                                                depending on the variables that are factored in with investments in the
                                                food industry. There is a great need for certified or official bank

                                        <p>Gabby foods produce vegan food products and also engage in catering services. The company started in a kitchen with just three people doing some experiments. The first product was vegetarian sausage which was studied for about 4 months before it was proved to be ready for the market. As sales increased the company decided to buy a sausage blender and a manual filler.  After six months of operating  the company suggested to employ few workers to help during production, raw material purchasing and marketing the product. For the first 6 months , the company concentrated their market in Harare CBD. The marketers had to go into health shops , Adventist conferences and some individuals in town advertising the product . After 3 weeks of the initiation we had about 3 regular customers and some individuals who would buy direct from the company. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>On the seventh month of operation we then decided to move into other towns like Gweru , kwekwe, Rusape and adventist schools in different towns . We started advertising our products to Adventist Book Centre in Gweru and also to schools. Our market share increased as we moved to other town.  So far we are producing vegetarian sausages, vegan meatballs and vegan burgers. The following the are the products still under construction and study: vegetarian polony, vegetarian , mince , baobab drink and granola cereal.

                                                This burger is one that has been loved by our regular clients. If you
                                                would like to bite into our history of burger production, Try this
                                                vegetarian burger, the Zimbabwe Original Burger which was the second
                                                product made by Carlson at Gabby foods in 2017. Enjoy these vegan
                                                burgers in a bun, with a fruit salad. You can also add some chips to
                                                enjoy the meal. The burger is made from vegetable protein (Soya • Wheat)
                                                • Sunflower oil • Starch • Wheat flour and natural spices. One of the
                                                best reasons for choosing a Gabby”s veggie burger is to cut saturated
                                                fat. Depending on its size, a regular hamburger’s four to seven grams of
                                                saturated fat are a significant part of the recommended daily limit of
                                                15 to 25 grams, which varies according to a person’s calorie needs and
                                                blood cholesterol level. Our veggie burgers contain from zero to 1 gram
                                                of saturated fat.
                                                If you want to eat soy for isoflavones (natural phytochemicals that
                                                might lower the risk of cancer or help with symptoms of menopause), you
                                                should eat Gabbys burger. A veggie burger may have 6 mg at most. Soy
                                                protein isolate, which is the kind of soy protein in some veggie
                                                burgers, retains its isoflavones.

                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> The size of a veggie burger affects its nutrition content, and its size is
                                                another reason why it is a healthy choice.this is tyhe reaason why
                                                Gabbys veggie burger is small. Most veggie burgers weigh 2.5 ounces, or
                                                71 grams, and have 70 to 170 calories each. A “standard” meat portion,
                                                in contrast, is three ounces after cooking.. To eat a healthier regular
                                                burger, you could reduce its size.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> If you choose veggie burgers for the benefits of soy, check that you’re
                                                getting what you want. Veggie burgers with soy contain soy protein that
                                                can help reduce blood cholesterol, but not all the protein is from soy.
                                                Thanks to our foodscientits they included soy in their burger which is
                                                rtheir chief ingredients.

                                        <p> Our sausages are made using fennel seeds, garlic and cayenne spices which
                                                have a variety of health benefits to our bodies. Fennel allows
                                                longevity, courage, and strength. In addition to its use as medicinal
                                                values, fennel has many health benefiting nutrients, essential
                                                compounds, antioxidants, dietary fiber, minerals, and vitamins.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> Our sausages contain numerous flavonoid anti-oxidants like kaempferol and
                                                quercetin from fennel. These compounds function as powerful antioxidants
                                                by removing harmful free radicals from the body thus offer protection
                                                from cancers, infection, aging and degenerative neurological diseases.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> They also are a rich source of dietary fiber. 100 g fennel seeds provide
                                                39.8 g of fiber. Much of this roughage is metabolically inert insoluble
                                                fiber, which helps increase the bulk of the food by absorbing water
                                                throughout the digestive system and easing constipation problems.
                                                Further, dietary fibers bind to bile salts (produced from cholesterol)
                                                and decrease their re-absorption in the colon. It thus helps lower serum
                                                LDL cholesterol levels. Together with flavonoid anti-oxidants, fiber
                                                composition of our sausages and burgers helps protect the colon mucosa
                                                from cancers.

                                        <p> Our products compose of health benefiting volatile essential oil compounds
                                                such as anethole, limonene, anisic aldehyde, pinene, myrcene, fenchone,
                                                chavicol, and cineole. These active principles in the fennel are known
                                                to have antioxidant, digestive, carminative, and anti-flatulent
                                                properties.Spices used concentrated source of minerals like copper,
                                                iron, calcium, potassium, manganese, selenium, zinc, and magnesium.
                                                Copper is essential for the production of red blood cells. Iron is
                                                required for red blood cell formation. Zinc is a co-factor in many
                                                enzymes that regulate growth and development, sperm generation,
                                                digestion and nucleic acid synthesis. Potassium is an important
                                                component of cell and body fluids that helps controlling heart rate and
                                                blood pressure. The human body uses manganese as a cofactor for the
                                                important antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase.

                                        <p> Furthermore, our sausages indeed are the storehouse for many vital vitamins.
                                                Vitamin-A, vitamin-E, vitamin-C as well as many B-complex vitamins like
                                                thiamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin and niacin particularly are concentrated
                                                in fennel seeds. And these vitamins are good for all vegetarians.

                                        <p> The health benefits of our sausage include relief from anemia, indigestion,
                                                flatulence, constipation, colic, diarrhea, respiratory disorders,
                                                menstrual disorders, and its benefits regarding eye care. Fennel, which
                                                has the scientific name Foeniculum Vulgare Miller, or its essence, is
                                                widely used around the world in mouth fresheners, toothpastes, desserts,
                                                antacids and in various culinary applications.

                                        <p> Sietan is a new product after a hard work by our project team who combined
                                                their hands and minds to come up with a wonderful product which is loved
                                                by many of our customers. Sietan is a brainchild project of CARLSON
                                                MPUPUNI who always come up with powerful projects for the company. The
                                                idea of adding this products was for vartiety. Nothing much is of
                                                difference from vegan balls, only some changes in some of the spices
                                                that gives this product a unique flavour and taste. Gabbys food products
                                                remain very unique and different from other vegetarian products from
                                                different producers due to the fact that we wantg to promote health
                                                living style to everyone arounus .Sietan is one of the cheapest products
                                                produced at Gabbys vegetarian products with wonderful and amazing
                                                benefits. The health benefits of our sietan include relief from anemia,
                                                indigestion, flatulence, constipation, colic, diarrhea, respiratory

                                                Spices used during sitan production also help in mouth freshening
                                                toothpastes, desserts, antacids and in various culinary applications.

                                        <p> definition of seitan: Although it is made from wheat, seitan has little in
                                                common with flour or bread. Also called “wheat meat”, "wheat protein",
                                                “wheat gluten” or simply “gluten”, seitan becomes surprisingly similar
                                                to the look and texture of meat when cooked, making it a popular meat
                                                substitute.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> Gabbys Seitan is also high in protein, making it a popular protein source
                                                for vegetarians and vegans. We use seitan as a vegetarian mock meat, and
                                                seitan is also the base for several commercially available products such
                                                as Tofurky deli slices and other vegetarian meat substitutes.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> Similar to the way tofu is sometimes used in vegetarian cooking, many
                                                vegetarian and vegan recipes call for seitan as a meat substitute, such
                                                as seitan stir-fry or grilled seitan which we do during lunch
                                                preparation. Gabbys Seitan can have lots of different flavors, just like
                                                chicken can be hot and spicy as in chicken wings, or savory in a
                                                succulent Indian or Thai curry. It has a savory taste, somewhat mild on
                                                its own, probably close to a bit bland chicken or a portobello mushroom.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> But the real reason why Gabbys seitan is so popular is more because of its
                                                texture than its taste, especially when compared to other alternatives,
                                                such as tofu or tempeh, which don't really have a "meaty" texture.
                                                Gabbys seitan is quickly gaining popularity, particularly in vegetarian
                                                restaurants, due to its ability to take on the texture and flavor of
                                                meat. You'll find it thinly sliced as a meat substitute on vegetarian
                                                sandwiches, turned into saucy and succulent wings or "ribs" and I've
                                                occasionally seen it as a vegetarian pizza topping. Prepared seitan can
                                                be found in the refrigerated section of most health food stores like
                                                vegan delights and perfect health shop in Harare and is sealed in a
                                                plastic.

                                        <h6><b>How to Cook Seitan</b></h6>
 <br>
                                        <p> Once you've made your seitan (or purchased it), seitan always needs to be
                                                cooked in one way or another, in order to turn it into a delicious
                                                vegetarian or vegan meal. A quick pan-fry with a splash of tamari, soy
                                                sauce or nama shoyu is one way to quickly cook your seitan, and I also
                                                like to simmer it with a bit of curry powder and top it off with
                                                nutritional yeast if I'm not doing something fancy with it.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> Need more ideas? Seitan is great on an outdoor grill or on an indoor grill
                                                pan - just slap on some barbecue sauce and heat it on up. Toss some
                                                seitan into the pan to get it lightly browned before you add vegetables
                                                to make a vegetable stir-fry, add to just about any Thai curry or really
                                                any vegetarian curry recipe, or add bits to a soup or stew for a
                                                plant-based protein boost.
                                        </p> <br>
                                        <p> Nutritionally, seitan is a powerhouse. In both quantity and quality, the
                                                protein in seitan is similar or more to that in beef. Sirloin steak and

                                                This is twice as much as an equal amount of tofu and 40% more than is

                                                pies. The idea came as a request from many bachelors in the town who

                                        <p>Pies are defined by their crusts. A filled pie (also single-crust or
                                                bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the filling is
                                                placed on top of the pastry but left open. A top-crust pie has the
                                                filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry or other
                                                covering before baking. A two-crust pie has the filling completely
                                                enclosed in the pastry shell. Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of
                                                pastry used for gabbys pie crusts, but many things can be used, mashed

                                        <p>Gabbys Pies are high in energy, so keep an eye on your portion size, as you
                                                can consume a lot of calories in only a few mouthfuls. Eating it as part
                                                of a meal with vegetables on the side can make a smaller portion go
                                                further. Having a pie or pasty as a snack is such a good idea – it is
                                                high in calories and you may still eat a normal meal later.

                                                idea was to produce a cereal which provide with some natural fats which

                                        <p> Gabbys Granola cereal is traditionally composed of rolled oats, which are
                                                oat groats that have been pressed flat and lightly steamed, as well as
                                                honey, nuts, and puffed wheated bran to mention a few. The entire
                                                mixture is baked until crispy and can then be taken anywhere quite

                                                outdoor-oriented people who won’t have a refrigerator for their food and
                                                don’t want to worry about crushing anything that they plan to eat. When
                                                eaten at home, Gabbys granola is often combined with honey,
                                                strawberries, bananas, and other types of fruit, or mixed in with other
